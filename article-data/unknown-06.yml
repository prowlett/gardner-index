    note: "Book first published 1989. No other dates given on copyright page, but presumably the articles aren't all from 1989."
  - who: "Peter Rowlett"
    when: "6 September 2022"
    note: "Opening refers to 'the decade since my column on Penrose tiling ran in ... January 1977', presumably referring to the previous chapter. Cites reference from 1988. Is this an additional chapter written only for the book?"
  - who: "Peter Rowlett"

    note: "I have assigned all but one Mathematical Games column to a book chapter, and I have four other articles by Martin Gardner in Scientific American which do no correspond to chapters. I have inspected this chapter in reference to these five articles and there is no match. I conclude this was not originally a Scientific American column."
