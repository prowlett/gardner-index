    note: "Refers to 1988, when the book was written, so is this an additional chapter written for the book not based on any article?"

    note: "I have assigned all but one Mathematical Games column to a book chapter, and I have four other articles by Martin Gardner in Scientific American which do no correspond to chapters. I have inspected this chapter in reference to these five articles and there is no match. I conclude this was not originally a Scientific American column."
