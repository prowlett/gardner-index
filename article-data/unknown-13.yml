  - who: "Peter Rowlett"
    when: "6 September 2022"
    note: "Book first published 1989. No other dates given on copyright page, but presumably the articles aren't all from 1989."
  - who: "Peter Rowlett"
    when: "4 November 2023"
    note: "Refers to 1987, after the last Mathematical Games column. Has an addendum, so presumably not written originally for this book, but for another source?"
  - who: "Peter Rowlett"
    when: "5 November 2023"
    note: "I have assigned all but one Mathematical Games column to a book chapter, and I have four other articles by Martin Gardner in Scientific American which do no correspond to chapters. I have inspected this chapter in reference to these five articles and there is no match. I conclude this was not originally a Scientific American column."
