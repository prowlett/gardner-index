    note: "I have now gone through book 4 and located everything except this. It is short, and in the text he refers to it having been published in Charlie Rice's column Punchbowl in This Week. So I'm almost certain it doesn't appear in Mathematical Games, and if I have located all the columns and this remains, I will be certain."
  - who: "Peter Rowlett"
    when: "5 November 2023"
    note: "I have assigned all but one Mathematical Games column to a book chapter, and I have four other articles by Martin Gardner in Scientific American which do no correspond to chapters. I have inspected this chapter in reference to these five articles and there is no match. I conclude this was not originally a Scientific American column."
