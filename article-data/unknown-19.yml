    note: "I have now gone through book 4 and located everything except this. It is short, and in the text he refers to it having been published in Charlie Rice's column Punchbowl in This Week. So I'm almost certain it doesn't appear in Mathematical Games, and if I have located all the columns and this remains, I will be certain."
