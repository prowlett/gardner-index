    note: "I had thought this might be 'The flip-strip sonnet, the lipogram and other mad modes of wordplay', but the next chapter says this one inspired an article in Time on 10 Jan 1977 and 'The flip-strip sonnet...' was the Feb 1977 article. Is it likely the Feb issue of Scientific American appeared early enough to have inspired a Time article on 10 Jan?"
