    note: "I had thought this might be 'The flip-strip sonnet, the lipogram and other mad modes of wordplay', but the next chapter says this one inspired an article in Time on 10 Jan 1977 and 'The flip-strip sonnet...' was the Feb 1977 article. Is it likely the Feb issue of Scientific American appeared early enough to have inspired a Time article on 10 Jan?"

    note: "Mathematical Magic Show page 134 says the February 1977 column is about OuLiPo. So despite the timing above, I've assigned this chapter to this article. I've chosen chapter 6 over chapter 7 because it seems likely chapter 7 was written specially for the book (see note there)."
