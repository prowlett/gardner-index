    note: "I'm pretty sure this is wrong. The chapter contains a selection of short questions, some of which are jokes/tricks, which seems to align with the article title. However, Mathematical Magic Show page 133-4 says the August 1968 explains crossed Mobius bands and the chapter in Wheels etc. does not."
