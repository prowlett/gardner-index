    note: "I have assigned all but this one Mathematical Games column to a book chapter. I have 296 Mathematical Games columns and one other article assigned to 297 chapters. I have checked the contents pages and there are 310 book chapters in the 15 books. I have inspected this chapter in reference to the 13 chapters I have not assigned to an original article and there is no match. I conclude this Scientific American Mathematical Games article was not reprinted in one of the 15 books."
